-- * Compositionality
--    The meaning of a complex expression is determined by its
--    structure and the meanings of its constituents.
--    http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compositionality/
-- The epitome:
--        eval (Add e1 e2) = eval e1 + eval e2
--
--    - Evaluators and other interpreters are compositional
--    - Denotational semantics must be compositional
--    - Compositionality is modularity
--    - Compositionality is context-insensitivity
--    - Bottom-up reconstruction of meaning
--    - Compositional processing is `fold'
--
--  The final approach embodies `fold'
--
-- Optimization and other such program transformations give many
-- examples of apparently non-compositional processing

-- * Pushing the negation down
-- Previously, expressions were constructed according to this grammar:
-- * General grammar of expressions
-- *     e ::= int | neg e | add e e
-- *
-- * Restricted grammar:
-- *     e ::= factor | add e e
-- *     factor ::= int | neg int
-- Now, only integer literals can be negated, and only once.


-- * //
-- We don't compute the value of the expression. Rather, we are doing
-- a _symbolic_ transformation: transforming an expression into a different
-- expression, which is equivalent with respect to some set of laws.

-- * push_neg is an expression transformer

push_neg (Add e1 e2) = Add (push_neg e1) (push_neg e2)

-- Add an extra negation
ti1n_norm = push_neg (Neg ti1)

-- see the result and its value
ti1n_norm_view = view ti1n_norm
