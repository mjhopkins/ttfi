-- This class defines syntax (and its instances, semantics) 
-- of our language

-- I could've moved s and z into a separate ``class Var var_repr''
-- Symantics would then have a single form
-- v :: var_repr h a -> repr h a

    app :: repr h (a->b) -> repr h a -> repr h b

-- * Like GADT-based, but in lower-case
-- * Like ExpSYM, but repr is of kind * -> * -> *
-- repr is parameterized by the environment (h) and the type
-- of the expression
-- * The types read like the rules of minimal logic
-- For example, z is the axiom stating that assuming A we can get A
-- lam is the inference rule: if assuming A we derive B,
-- then we can derive the implication A->B
-- * Type system of simply-typed lambda-calculus in Haskell98!
-- The signature of the class can be read off as the typing
-- rules for simply-typed lambda-calculus. But the code
-- is Haskell98! So, contrary to the common belief, we do not
-- need dependent types to express the type system of simply
-- typed lambda-calculus. Compare with Term.agda
-- * ``a way to write a typed fold function over a typed term.''
-- as one reviewer of our paper put it

-- td2o :: (Symantics repr) => repr (Int, h) (Int -> Int)
-- the inferred type says td2o is open! Needs the env with Int

td3 = lam (add (app z (int 1)) (int 2))
-- td3 :: (Symantics repr) => repr h ((Int -> Int) -> Int)

-- Ill-typed terms are not expressible
-- * td2a = app (int 1) (int 2)
--     Couldn't match expected type `a -> b' against inferred type `Int'
--       Expected type: repr h (a -> b)
--       Inferred type: repr h Int
--     In the first argument of `app', namely `(int 1)'

-- * R is not a tag!
-- The expression with unR _looks_ like tag introduction and
-- elimination. But the function unR is *total*. There is no 
-- run-time error is possible at all -- and this fact is fully 
-- apparent to the compiler.
-- * R is a meta-circular interpreter
-- It runs each object-language operation by executing the corresponding
-- metalanguage operation.
-- * R never gets stuck: no variant types, no pattern-match failure
-- * Well-typed programs indeed don't go wrong!
-- * R is total
-- * The instance R is a constructive proof of type soundness
-- First of all, we see the type preservation (for object types)
-- for interpretations: interpretations preserve types.
-- Then we see progress: the interpreter does not get stuck.
-- So we reduced the problem of type soundness of the object language
-- (simply-typed lambda-calculus) to the type soundness of the
-- metalanguage.
-- * R _looks_ like a reader monad (but h varies)
-- R looks like a reader monad, but the type of the environment
-- varies.
