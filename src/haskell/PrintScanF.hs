-- * The final view to the typed sprintf AND sscanf

module PrintScanF where

import Prelude hiding ((^))

-- This code defines a simple domain-specific language of string
-- patterns and demonstrates two interpreters of the language:
-- for building strings (sprintf) and parsing strings (sscanf).
-- This code thus solves the problem of typed printf/scanf sharing the
-- same format string, posed by Chung-chieh Shan.
-- This code presents scanf/printf interpreters in the final style;
-- it is thus the dual of the code in PrintScan.hs
-- September 2008.
-- See http://okmij.org/ftp/typed-formatting/

-- The typed sprintf problem has been investigated extensively: the first
-- solution was shown by Danvy; more solutions were proposed by Hinze and
-- Asai. The typed scanf problem received significantly less attention,
-- if any. It seems that the implementation of the typed sprintf and
-- sscanf sharing the same formatting specification has not been known.

-- We demonstrate that lambda-abstractions at the type level are
-- expressible already in the Hindley-Milner type system.

-- * Specification:
-- *  sprintf spec arg1 ... argn   ==> String
-- *  sscanf  input spec (\arg1 ... argn -> res)  ==> Maybe res
-- The typed sprintf takes the formatting specification and several
-- arguments and returns the formatted string. The types and the number
-- of arguments depend on the formatting specification. Conversely, the
-- typed sscanf parses a string according to the formatting
-- specification, passing parsed data to a consumer function. Again, the
-- number and the types of the arguments to the consumer depend on the
-- formatting specification. 

-- * Simple examples

tp1 = sprintf $ lit "Hello world"
-- "Hello world"
ts1 = sscanf "Hello world" (lit "Hello world")  ()
-- Just ()

tp2 = sprintf (lit "Hello " ^ lit "world" ^ char) '!'
-- "Hello world!"
ts2 = sscanf "Hello world!" (lit "Hello " ^ lit "world" ^ char) id
-- Just '!'

-- A formatting specification is built by connecting primitive
-- specifications (such as lit "string", int, char) with (^). We observe
-- that whereas 
--      sprintf $ lit "Hello world"
-- has the type String, 
--      sprintf $ lit "The value of " ^ char ^ lit " is " ^ int
-- has the type Char -> Int -> String. Likewise, the type of the consumer
-- of the values parsed by sscanf varies with the formatting specification.
-- The example of tp3 and ts3 demonstrates that sprintf and sscanf can
-- indeed use exactly the same formatting specification, which
-- is a first-class value.

-- * Main idea
-- The formatting specification is a `type transformer', a functor.

-- Examples: 
-- * sprintf (lit "xxx")     :: String
-- * sprintf int             :: Int -> String
-- * sprintf (char ^ int)    :: Char -> Int -> String
-- *
-- * sscanf inp (lit "xxx")  :: x - > Maybe x
-- * sscanf inp int          :: (Int -> x) -> Maybe x
-- * sscanf inp (char ^ int) :: (Char -> Int -> x) -> Maybe x
