-- Flatten the additions using the associativity
-- * (A + B) + R => A + (B + R)
-- Draw the trees for the former and the latter
-- The goal is to convert the addition tree to the right-skewed form
-- The transformation is assumed to be performed after the negation is
-- pushed down

-- Previously, expressions were constructed according to this grammar:
-- * General grammar of expressions
-- *     e ::= int | neg e | add e e
-- *
-- * Restricted grammar now:
-- *     e ::= factor | add factor e
-- *     factor ::= int | neg int
-- Now, only integer literals can be negated, and only once.

-- It is an expression transformer

-- The last two clauses express the lexicographic ordering
-- on left-depth, total depth.
